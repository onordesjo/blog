I'm thinking about ways to represent knowledge about the coronavirus in a more systematic fashion.

The idea is to have a common vocabulary to serve as support when new information comes to light, and to more easily be able to categorise the type of information that the health organisations communicate.

Some different categories that immediately come to mind are:

* Infection rates
* New treatments
* Indications that previously explored treatments work better/worse than previously thought
* Modes of spreading
* The state of quarantine measures in different locations

At the moment, there is (at least to my knowledge) no nice way to for example set up a notification system where it's possible to subscribe to such types of 'knowledge channels'.

I guess Google Alerts come close, but it's not quite the right thing.

Here is a first version of a knowledge graph that contains some elements which I think are important about the outbreak:
